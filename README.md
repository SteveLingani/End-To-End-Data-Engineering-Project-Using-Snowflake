## Overview

Welcome to my data engineering project repository. I found it fun to work on this incredible project as I am learning Snowflake. The project, built end-to-end, begins with ingesting data from JSON files, processes it through multiple layers, and culminates in a consumption layer for analytics. The results of these analytics can be conveniently visualized using a Snowsight dashboard. This repository serves as a one-stop solution for both the projectâ€™s code and its documentation. Enjoy exploring!

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several layers:
1. **Land Layer**: The initial landing layer where raw data in JSON format is stored.
- Used Json Cracker tool to visualize our deeply nested Jsons to understand their structure.
- Created internal Stage and Json File Format to store our Json files in Snowflake.

2. **RAW Layer**: The raw layer stores the ingested data without any transformation. It includes tasks to load data from JSON files into Snowflake tables.
- ingested our data in a Raw Format to MATCH_RAW_TABLE Table
  
3. **Clean Layer**: The clean layer is responsible for cleaning and transforming the raw data. It includes tasks to create clean tables that are more suitable for analysis.
- Created Three Tables in Clean Schema (Layer): Concerning Player , Match_detail , Delivery Table.
  
4. **Consumption Layer**: The consumption layer is designed for analytics and reporting. It includes the final tables and views that are used for creating dashboards.
- Use Data Modeling to build our Datawarehouse Facts and dimensions

5. **Dashboard**: The dashboard layer utilizes Snowsight to visualize the analytics results. It can be accessed for insightful data analysis and reporting.
6. **Automate Continuous Data Flow**: automating continuous data flow, specifically by creating automated tasks to listen to change data capture (CDC) and update data in all tables.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Snowflake account (Free Trial Account sufficient)
- Snowflake client (SnowSQL or Snowflake web interface)
- Access to Snowsight for dashboard creation

### Setup

1 - Execute the SQL scripts in each layer (Land, RAW, Clean, Consumption) in the correct order to create tables, streams, tasks, and views.

2 - Load data into the Land Layer using tasks or other data loading methods.

3 - Run the tasks in the RAW Layer to move data from the Land Layer to the RAW Layer.

4- Run subsequent tasks for cleaning and transforming data in the Clean Layer.

5- Finally, execute the tasks in the Consumption Layer to create the final tables and views for analytics.

6- Use Snowsight to access the dashboard and visualize the cricket analytics.

## Folder Structure

- Json Cricket files/: Contains our Json Files.
- Sql Worksheet/: Contains the SQL scripts used in all layers.
- dashboard/: Includes Screenshots and Sql Scripts related to the dashboard creation using Snowsight.
